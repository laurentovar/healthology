Healthology is a project created using Java, Springboot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, JQuery, FileStack API, Google charts and TalkJS API.

***Summary:***

Mental illness affects nearly one in five adults in America, but only 41 percent of those people have received professional help in the past year. We created Healthology because we wanted to provide a more easily accessible application that could provide assistance to people that need it. We know that people don't always have the time or ability to go to therapy in person so users are able to access Healthology in the comfort of their own homes. 

***Here are some features that a client can do:***

-All visitors of the website are able to access the resources page: This is where information about FAQ's and additional resources are located. 

-Clients can customize their profile: They can provide an about me summary that would be visible to other members of their groups. They can also upload a profile photo with the implementation of the Filestack API. 

-Clients can update client history and client contact information.

-Clients can create journals: Journals are used so that clients can express themselves and their emotions real time. We found that journals would be a valuable feature as studies have shown journaling can help manage stress and give better coping mechanisms. The Google Charts Developer Tool was implemented as an easy-to-read visual for the client to track their emotions throughout their use of Healthology. 

-Clients chat with people in their groups: TalkJS is implanted to be able to create live chat rooms for each group. This is where clients share their experiences and thoughts about their situations. Clients are able to build a strong support system that they are able to lean on. Clients are placed in groups based on their selections at registration. This is done through a many-to-many relationship.

-The therapists are able to see client information: The therapist views client information to get a better insight about their background and what they want to work on. The therapist uses this information to get in touch with clients emergency contact number and client current health care provider if a client is in a crisis. 

-The therapist is an admin on the groups: The therapist assigned to a group gives advice and helpful tips to group members.
